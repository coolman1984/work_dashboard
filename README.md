# Enhanced Project Report – Mermaid diagrams and plan artifacts

This repository contains artifacts to augment the project reporting with architecture diagrams and a plan document.

Artifacts
- [`plan.md`](plan.md) – Plan outlining goals, milestones and ownership.
- [`diagrams/architecture.mmd`](diagrams/architecture.mmd) – Mermaid diagram for Architecture.
- [`diagrams/data_flow.mmd`](diagrams/data_flow.mmd) – Mermaid diagram for Data Flow.
- [`README.md`](README.md) – This document.

How to view Mermaid diagrams
- Many editors support Mermaid rendering, or you can paste the code blocks into mermaid.live to visualize.

Usage
- The plan and diagrams are living artifacts. Update plan.md as goals evolve; diagrams should be kept in sync with UI and services.
- The dashboard now includes a **Tagged Files** button (toolbar) that opens a modal showing red, green, and yellow tagged files grouped by color for quick access.

Next steps
- If you want, we can add an automated report generator script to emit final_report.md. See plan.md for details.
